## Hi there!

I'm Ellie (pronouns they/them). I enjoy programming as a hobby, with a particular interest in
programming language development as of late - check out [gelix](https://gelix.angm.xyz)!.

Most of my projects are primarily hosted on my [GitLab](https://git.angm.xyz/ellie),
only finished projects tend to be mirrored here on GitHub.

The languages I would consider myself proficient in are Rust, Kotlin and Java, with
intermediate-level skills in Python/Django and Webdev with HTML, SASS and Vue.js.
